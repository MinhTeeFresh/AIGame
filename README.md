# AIGame
Our AI Game produced for the 2024 AI Symposium

This game is used to simulate the potential uses of LLM's for a real and adaptable interaction in games.
The NPCs created in this project are a product of Godot's game engine and GPT's LLM.

Users are able to run the sample code in Godot, which they will use arrow keys "up, down, left, and right" to move their character around.
When near an NPC, the user may interact with the "E" Button. This will activate the text prompt that will allow the user to converse with a uniquely prompted character.
Each of the two characters have different "personalities" that are prompted before the interaction begins. 
With this the user will have a unique experience conversing with each NPC.
The user can then use the "Esc" button to leave the interaction at any point.
